## 💼 About Me

I'm a data-driven economics graduate who enjoys building tools that help businesses make better decisions. My current strengths are in Excel, Power BI, and VBA automation — and I'm now expanding into Python and SQL to deepen my data analytics toolkit.

Whether it's financial dashboards, report automation, or economic modeling, I’m always aiming to improve efficiency and clarity through clean, impactful analysis.
